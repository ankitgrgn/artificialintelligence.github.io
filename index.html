    <h3><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Introduction</h3>
    <p><b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
      is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smart human think. AI is a study of how human brain think, learn, decide and work, when it tries to solve problems. And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems.The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, for example, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.
    <br>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts use the term <b>"artificial intelligence"</b> to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.
    <br>
    AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g, <b>Google)</b>, recommendation systems (used by <b>YouTube,Amazon and Netflix</b>), understanding human speech (such as <b>Siri and Alexa</b>), self-driving cars (e.g.,<b>Tesla</b>), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as <b>chess</b> and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,having become a routine technology.</p>

      <h4><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Importance of AI</h4><br>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b>Automation</b> :
            AI is able to automate a repetitive task that was previously done manually, without feeling any fatigue or having to take breaks like a human employee would need to do.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Enhancement</b> :
            AI can make products and services smarter and more effective, improving experiences for end-users, via capabilities like optimizing conversation bots or customer service menus, and delivering better product recommendations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Analysis</b> :
            AI can analyze data at a much faster rate than humans, allowing it to find patterns much more quickly, and it can also analyze much larger datasets than humans, allowing it to uncover patterns humans would simply miss.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Accuracy</b> :
            AI can be trained to become more accurate than humans, utilizingits ability to harvest and interpret data to come up with better decisions for tasks like picking financial investments or identifying cancerous growths on x-rays.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>ROI</b> :
            AI maximizes the value of data since it’s able to do a better job analyzing complex, multi-variate relationships, without having to take any breaks and with fewer mistakes, making it an incredibly important technology for any business that relies on data and operates at scale.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-star"></i><b>History of AI</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p> The history of <b>artificial intelligence</b> (AI) dates back to antiquity, when myths, stories, and rumors circulated about master artisans endowing artificial beings with intellect or conscience. Classical philosophers attempted to characterize the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols, which sowed the roots of modern AI. The programmable digital computer, a machine based on the abstract basis of mathematical reasoning, was invented in the 1940s as a result of this effort. This technology, as well as the concepts behind it, prompted a group of scientists to carefully consider the prospect of creating an electronic brain.
    </p>
<br><p>During the summer of 1956, a workshop on the campus of Dartmouth College in the United States established the discipline of AI research.For decades, those who attended would be at the forefront of AI research. Many of them projected that in less than a generation, a computer as clever as a human will exist, and they were paid millions of dollars to make this vision a reality.
</p><br>
<p>
  Eventually, it became clear that the project's difficulty had been severely underestimated by commercial developers and researchers.The US and British governments ceased supporting undirected artificial intelligence research in 1973, in response to criticism from James Lighthill and continued congressional pressure, and the difficult years that followed became known as the "AI winter." Seven years later, a visionary program by the Japanese government prompted governments and industry to invest billions of dollars in AI, but investors became disillusioned by the late 1980s and withdrew funding once more.
