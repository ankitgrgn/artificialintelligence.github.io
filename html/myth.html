                    Watch out AI is scary! The robots are going to come and take us over! They are going to steal our jobs and enslave us all!!

                    Woah just <span class="large-txt">WAIT</span> a minute... These are outragous thoughts and lets chat about why.

                    Here are some common myths about AI and why you shouldn't be worried.

                    <p>
                        Now yes, AI is likely to take over labor jobs, we are seeing a glimps of that today, however we need to take a look at the whole picture here to debunk this myth.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        If we look back to the Industrial Revolution what did we see? We saw a huge population shift from rural agriculture to factory workers in the cities. 
                        These new jobs were less labor intensive and often a higher salary. Additionally, what else did we see a surge of during this time perior? Innovation!!
                        Important inventions and discoveries were made such as the steam engine/trains, machine tools, and cement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now what does this have to do with AI taking our jobs today? Well with AI taking over labor intensive jobs, 
                        we will see more and more people moving to jobs where they can work in smarter and more inovative ways.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Just imagine what this new work force could create and produce in the future!
                    </p>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <h1 class="myth-title">High-skilled workers aren't affected.</h1>
                    <h2 class="myth-tag">MYTH #2</h2>

                    <p>
                        This myth is just that a myth. AI has a huge potential to help out even the most high-skilled professions.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>
                        A good example of this could be machine learning algorithms that scan hospital patient's scans or x-rays.
                        The AI would be much more efficient at detecting early signs of deseases comparied to the doctor. 
                        Additionally, this would allow the patients doctor to spend more time with their patient, human to human.
                    </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        Another example of this would be an AI that helps a lawer scans thousands of documents quickly for important pieces to a case.
                        Again this is would give the lawer more time with their client and more time to create persuasive arguments to present in court.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just a few examples that show how AI could automate boring tasks for high-skilled workers saving them time which they can then spend with their client or patient.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="myth-title">AI are better then humans at everything!</h1>
                </div>    
                <div class="content">            
                    <p>
                        We do see AIs that are much better then humans at a specific task, these are refered to as specialized AIs. 
                        This could be an AI that is really good at looking at x-rays as described earlier.
                    </p>
                        However, it will be quite a while before we see robots that are capable of percieving the world as we do.
                        This is known as generalized AIs, which is what most people think of when they here AI (A robot that can think on it's own much like humans do and do it better).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The human brain is so complicated and scientists aren't even entirally sure how it works! 
                        And to be able to replicate this will be a long process and even if it does happen it will be far in the future.
                        Also, who's to say the robots aren't nice?

                    <h1 class="myth-title">Our intelligence will be surpassed.</h1>
                    <h2 class="myth-tag">MYTH #4</h2>

                    <p>
                        In order to assess if AIs can surpass our intelligence it is important to think about how to measure intelligence.
                        Now that's a hard question because if we define it as how past data can be processed and how much information can be stored,
                        well then computers have already surpassed us on that.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        However, our ability to look at situations with creativity is remarkable and so is our ability to weight in our emotions when making decisions!
                        Thus if you look at the creativity and emotional side of intelligence then we are much more superior and will remain superior to AIs.

                    <h2 class="myth-tag">MYTH #5</h2>
                    <h1 class="myth-title">Robots will enslave and destroy us!</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        People actually believe this, that the growth of AI will lead to robots enslaving us in the future. But before you believe this too I pose a question, who is creating these AIs?
                        The answer is humans! Humans are creating AIs and in a distant future where robots would have the technological ability to enslave us, a lot of boundaries would need to have been broken for this to happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Society would have to allow for the creation of AIs that see it fit to harm humans, but for society to allow this to happen is very unlikely.
                        For example, a new organization called 'Partnership on AI' was put together by partners such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft.
                        The mission statement on PartnershipOnAI.org says, "study and formulate best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's understanding of AI, and to serve as an open 
                        platform for discussion and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Society knows that AI can be a threat and in order to handle that threat organizations like 'Partnership on AI' and major companies who are in fact driving AI to new levels 
                        are partnering up to hold each other and the rest of the world accountable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So the fear of robots taking over is practically sci-fi and there is no need to worry about it.
